    Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files
Why Python?
    Python works on different platforms.
    Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language

----- Numpy Introduction
What is Numpy?
Numpy is a python library use for working with arrays
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices
Numpy stands for Numerical Python

Why Use Numpy?
In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
Numpy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster that traditional Python lists
The array object in Numpy is called 'ndarray', it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working 
Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important

Why is Numpy Faster that Lists?
Numpy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlik lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently
This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science
